## Spotify Project

The first step in this project was using the Spotify api to get the data for my personal saved songs.  

You can see the process [here](./)

After getting all the songs and audio features, I clustered my library using PCA for dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering.

That notebook is [here](./Cluster_spotify.html)

Playlists with the songs closest to cluster centers are below and give some quite interesting blends of music.

Finally, I built a tableau visualization for the clusters.
