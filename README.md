## About Me
I am a pursuing a masters in biostatistics at the University of Michigan School of Public Health with an anticipated graduation date of May 2026. 

As a strategic problem solver, I develop data products using the Data Science lifecycle, machine learning, and statistical analysis. At the core of my success is my ability to effectively collaborate with business partners, data engineers, and machine learning engineers to create reliable production solutions with domain specific expertise. By clearly translating business challenges from technical analysis to digestible insights, I provide instant value to cross-functional teams. Swiftly learning new technologies and languages within the scope of a full machine learning problem energizes me.


## Professional Experience


Outside of work, I am a huge sports junkie, specifically Philadelphia and Michigan sports.  I am also passionate about music and in the future I plan on applying data science to music with the hope of creating algorithmic based music.  If you have any ideas or interest in this, I would love to talk about it!

## Projects
Below are some of the school and personal projects that I have had the pleasure to work on.  There is a wide variety of applications demonstrated in my catalog and I very much enjoy trying and learning from new challenges.

### Fast Matrix Normal R Package (Nov - Dec 2024)
We developed [this R package](https://github.com/ziyuliu1999/fastMN) that decreased the complexity of computing the PDF and random sampling of the matrix normal distribution. My major contribution was creating the PDF function using Cholesky decomposition, which reduced the complexity from O(n^3 * p^3) to O(n^3 + p^3).  

### Live betting database (Aug 2020-Jan 2022)

### Computer Vision (Jan-Apr 2020)
This course is an introduction to 2D and 3D computer vision. Topics include: cameras models, the geometry of multiple views; shape reconstruction methods from visual cues: stereo, shading, shadow, contours; low-level image processing methodologies such as edge detection, feature detection; mid-level vision techniques (segmentation and clustering); Basic high-level vision problems: face detection, object and scene recognition, object categorization, and human tracking
