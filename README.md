## About Me
I am currently a Data Engineer at Freedom Mortgage.  I graduated in May 2020 from the University of Michigan studying Data Science.  I have taken courses in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Applied Regression Analysis, Bayesian Data Analysis, Web Systems, Database Management Systems, and Honors Multivariable Calculus.  I have experience coding in a variety of languages but in my daily work I primarily use Python and SQL.  

In summer 2019, I interned for Wacker Chemical Corporation, an international chemical company for highly developed specialty chemicals.  I was a part of the new Data Science team where I led the sales forecasting project for a business team.  Using models like SARIMA, LSTM, and SVR I was able to develop a model that improved the current forecasting tool by 10% less deviation in 2019.  Another fun project I worked on was Natural Language Processing of Twitter data.  I scraped tweets containing specific keywords and hashtags pertaining to our customers and their market segments.  We did some sentiment analysis of these tweets and presented our findings to the marketing managers.

Outside of work, I am a huge sports junkie, specifically Philadelphia and Michigan sports.  I am also passionate about music and in the future I plan on applying data science to music with the hope of creating algorithmic based music.  If you have any ideas or interest in this, I would love to talk about it!
