### EECS 442 Research Project
The final project for the course was independent research on any topic of interest in computer vision.  My group decided to look into Optimal Character Recognition.  We built a complete OCR pipeline to process pdf text files and convert them to images and classify the characters using a Convolutional Neural Network.  This pipeline was tested on different fonts and with different CNN architectures.

You can view our complete final paper [here](./EECS442_FinalProject.pdf)

In it you can find the base CNN architecture and different iterations of layer and preprocessing experimentation.

Additionally, the [code](./CNN.ipynb) to train and build the CNN was created using Google Colab.
