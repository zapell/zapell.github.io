## Diagnosing Diabetes

### Overview
We built a model to predict whether or not a patient had diabetes.
This is useful in rural areas where it would be beneficial to efficiently allocate resources and this model could serve as an initial screening for diabetes. 
We used two different types of models: Logistic Regression and Bayesian Logistic Regression.
One of the main advantages of Bayesian Logistic Regression is the ability to set priors on coefficients.
We used the coefficient estimates from our Logistic Regression as priors for our Bayesian model and seeing how they compare.
