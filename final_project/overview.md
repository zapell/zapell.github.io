## üìä Dataset & Analysis

### Data Source
- **Origin**: [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) (Kaggle)
- **Scope**: 392 observations of Pima Indian descent females (age 21+) after data cleaning
- **Innovation**: First known application of Bayesian Logistic Regression to this dataset

### Data Quality Management
- **Missing Values**: Comprehensive handling of incomplete records
- **Target Population**: Focused analysis on Pima Indian heritage females
- **Sample Size**: Optimized dataset of 392 cleaned observations

### Exploratory Data Analysis

## üßÆ Modeling Approach

### Feature Selection
**Backward Selection Process** identified optimal predictors:
- Age
- Blood Pressure  
- Glucose levels
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- BMI (Body Mass Index)

### Model Architecture
1. **Traditional Logistic Regression**: Baseline performance establishment
2. **Bayesian Logistic Regression**: STAN implementation with R (rstan package)
3. **Prior Information**: Traditional model coefficients used as Bayesian priors

### Technical Implementation
- **Programming**: R statistical environment with STAN for Bayesian computation
- **Package**: rstan for Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling
- **Validation**: Rigorous train/test split methodology

## üìà Results & Performance

### Model Comparison
| Model Type | Accuracy | Key Advantages |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| **Traditional Logistic** | **85%** | Simpler implementation, higher accuracy |
| **Bayesian Logistic** | 70% | Prior incorporation, uncertainty quantification |

### Clinical Impact
- **Healthcare Application**: Effective preliminary screening tool for resource-limited settings
- **Population Specificity**: Tailored for Pima Indian demographic characteristics
- **Resource Optimization**: Enables efficient allocation of diagnostic resources in rural healthcare

### Limitations & Considerations
- **Demographic Scope**: Limited to females aged 21+ of Pima Indian heritage
- **Data Constraints**: Performance influenced by inherent dataset correlations
- **Model Selection**: Traditional approach demonstrated superior predictive accuracy for this application
